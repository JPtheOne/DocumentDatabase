# DocumentDatabase
Python application that retrieves and indexes documents stored on a mySQL database. The database is available on the text files. Once you've created the database on you connection, you'll be able to run the program.
Keep in mind pip installation as follows for the needed libraries:
```
pip install spacy
```

Once it is installed, you should obtain a menu like this:
